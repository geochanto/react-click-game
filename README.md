# React Click Game
This is a simple game created using React. The application renders different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
